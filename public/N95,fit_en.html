<p>N95 (and equivalent) masks are designed to catch small particles, that is 95% or better filtration. The 95% filtration is for particles of size 0.2-0.3 microns. Both smaller and larger particles are filtered better. When attention is paid to the nose wire and all the gaps around the mask, air leakage can be mimimalized and filtration can go up. In 2022 and if 'fitted' (fit testing, qualitative or qunatitative) these are your best choice. Even if not fit tested, N95 or better respirators, when worn properly provide excellent protection. Take care to choose a respriator model that suits your face type and shape. In this modelling, a 99% effective filtration is assumed for particles of cocnern when an N95 grade respirator has been fit tested. </p>
