<p>N95 (and equivalent) masks are designed to catch small particles, that is 95% or better filtration. The 95% filtration is for particles of size 0.2-0.3 microns. Both smaller and larger particles are filtered better. When attention is paid to the nose wire and all the gaps around the mask, air leakage can be mimimalized and filtration can go up. Even if not fit tested, N95 or better respirators, when worn properly provide excellent protection. Take care to choose a respriator model that suits your face type and shape. If not wron properly, there might be small gaps. Air going through the gaps is unfiltered - protection is lower.</p>
