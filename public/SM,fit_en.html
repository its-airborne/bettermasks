<p>Surgical masks are referred to as fluid resistant surgical mask. They are designed to catch droplets not block aerosols. Even if the material itself has good filtration, the problem is these masks are not designed to fit around face perfectly. When attention is paid to the nose wire and all the gaps around the mask, air leakage can be mimimalized. Air breathed in now passes through the mask material and effective filtration can go up. In this modelling, an 80% filtration has been assigned for surgical masks with a fit enhancing brace. In 2022 you could say these are unsafe masks by default, but if 'fitted', can be a lot safer.</p>
