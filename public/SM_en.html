<p>Surgical masks are designed to catch droplets not block aerosols. They do not fit well enough around face and are leaky. So, inspite of the material itself having good filtration, effective filtration of air breathed in reduces. In 2022 you could say these are unsafe masks as Omicron variant is more transmissible. In this model, a 50% effective filtration has been cosndiered for surgical masks without any fit enahncing modification.</p>
